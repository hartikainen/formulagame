Here's the help file for the Formula Game 9K!

The width of the track is defined in the beginning of the track.py file.
Player names must atleast 1 character long and may not include spaces.

Start the game by pressing the start button.

The quick game will start a game with track found in "track1.txt" and 
player names "player1" and "player2".

The cars can be moved by numbers 1-9.

If you hit the other car you will lose.

The one who drives over the finish line faster, wins the game. The results will be saved to the results.txt.

Bananas (marked by x on the map) move the direction of the car!

HAVE FUN!
